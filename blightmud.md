# Blightmud

Blightmud is a mac/linux mud client written in rust. It's completely terminal based and features separated input and output areas.

Writing my own mudclient for the terminal has always been a passionproject of mine from the days when I actually played a lot of muds. These days however I mostly put work into the client or other projects and don't actually play much.
