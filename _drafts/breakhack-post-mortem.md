So, I'm done adding features to BreakHack. I had a blast making the game and updating it.
Since money was never the real goal when releasing the game I was never really concerned
with purchases and major followings of the game. I just wanted to make it.

However, if I'f have plans on earning some money through my game then here is a list of things that
I could have done better. I'll give you the short list and then explain each point in it's own time.

- Patience and early release
- Play testers
- Beta testers
- General installation confirmation
- Marketing
