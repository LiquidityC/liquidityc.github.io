So, I've been writing a lot of C lately. Coming from a background of almost only
coding in object oriented languages I had a feeling in the back of my mind that
the project would eventually get disorganized and chaotic. But, partly due to my
fear of this ever happening it never did.

I structured my code in a manner that I picked up from the
[gnome-todo](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Todo) project where one would almost
simulate classes through files and their included functions.

Thanks to this I still find my game rather structured when looking at the code
and making changes. Sure it won't be extended to anything else but a game any
time soon. But I think that is besides the point. All this lead me to think
about java, and how many java programmers I know find languages that aren't
object oriented, daunting. When in fact I came to the realization that it all
comes down to discipline. Sure, some languages (C included) will allow you to
make quick hacks that might solve a problem but gradually as the hacks become
more frequent they will cause the code quality and maintainability to decay in
the project. In contrary to staying disciplined. Doing things according to the
rules you or the project manager set up and not taking shortcuts.

Having a solid background in Java development I came to the conclusion that a
lot of the design decisions and restrictions in Java are put there in order to
prevent developers from being stupid. This might not be true at all, but I can't
help thinking that there is some merit to my thought.

It's funny to think that many of the popular programming languages are designed
to protect developers from ruining the project. :D

Anywho, this isn't a massive epiphany in any way. It's just me ranting and
nobody reading :P

Until next time,
