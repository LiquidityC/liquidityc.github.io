<p>So, I'm an avid vim user since many years back. Always happy to find new cool plugins to make my days easier.</p>
<p>Anywho, the other day I was browsing through my front page on reddit and stumbled across a link to a video on <a href="http://vimcasts.org/">this</a> page. After watching the video I immediately began scanning for stuff that could be new to me. I found some good stuff. But in particular I found <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/meet-ultisnips/">this</a> which lead to <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/ultisnips-python-interpolation/">this</a> and <a href="http://vimcasts.org/episodes/ultisnips-visual-placeholder/">this</a>.</p>
<p>Now to the meat of the post. <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips">UltiSnips</a> is a fantastic plug-in for vim. The applications in my everyday coding seem to be limitless and since all the snips are custom made they will always suit me. Sure there is some time spent on creating them, but the creation process is embedded in my regular coding creating a very smooth work flow. Code, insert snips, code, create/edit snips, code. <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/articles/The_Brillant_Paula_Bean">Brillant!</a></p>
<p>I'll try to get back with more stuff more frequently. This is certainly not the first cool thing I found on the web since my last post. It's just that I usually just end up telling colleagues at work about things I find and then it ends there.</p>
