...I finally decided to write a new post. That, honestly, nobody is going to be
reading.

I'm on parental leave now, it's probably been the longest time I've ever gone
without coding anything. When I finally did start working on something, after
about 4-5 months of radio silence, it's a new game, with a new engine. Completely
based on SDL2 still but this time written in good ol' C.

The idea is a basic roguelike. Prettier then nethack but probably with less
finesse and functionality. A quick 10-15 minute break from life. Hence the name
"BreakHack". Hopefully I will get this one done.

The main reason for starting was that I felt I needed some C practice. It's not
as tricky as I recall. Probably dues to my hours of practice with C++ now. I
guess it's just different thinking when you don't actually have classes to work
off of. I checked some basic "how to structure C" articles to get a feel for how
professionals do it. Seems I have matched their recommendations even before I
read the articles. Guess that short work I did for gnome-todo actually left an
impact on C structuring.

Until next time, I'll be working on my rouge like nethack similar game and hope
I get something playable this time.

I'm aiming for the following:

- Playable prototype
- Fine tuning
- More playable stuff
- Nicer looks/More details

I found a nice stack of artwork for this game released under the CC license that
I will be using. It's freeing up a lot of time. Also I'm letting the existing
artwork decide what goes in the game which is handy for inspiration.
